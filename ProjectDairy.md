      - push - Pushing files from local to remote repository
      - remote - With no arguments, shows a list of existing remotes.

  * Best practices (Before pushing changes to remote anvitha)
  ```
  git checkout develop          # from local anvitha to local develop
  git branch -a                 # to view all branches present locally and remotely
  git fetch origin              # git pull origin (remote develop) can be used for 
  git merge origin              # these 2 steps
  git checkout anvitha        # local anvitha
  git merge develop             # with local branch develop
  git status
  git push origin anvitha     # remote aniruddha

  ```
